# mango Management tools

The `mango-management` crate provides a framework for building CLI tools for various
purposes.  The purpose of breaking these into multiple tools is to simplify the user
experience, and prevent confusion between the different use cases.

### The Tools
```
mango-management
|-> mango-genesis-tool = A tool for performing the genesis ceremony for the mango blockchain.
|-> mango-operational-tool = A tool for performing management operations on the mango blockchain.
```

There are README's for each tool individually.
